# Ball is Life

This is a web application that I have built to display the shot charts of NBA players. The app is unpolished, but I am continuing to put work into it to make it better.

The app is deployed and can be seen here:

Props to Nick Bottomley for creating the [NBA API Endpoints](https://github.com/nickb1080/nba), which is where the data comes from.

### Stuff used to make this:

 * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for rendering the views
 * [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for creating a React boilerplate
 * [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for managing application state
 * [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for creating the shotchart
 * [Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) for the application styles
 * [Koa](http://koajs.com/) for creating a backend to create  APIs for the app to interact with and serving the files
